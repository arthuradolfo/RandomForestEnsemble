# RandomForestEnsemble
A random forest ensemble with flexible parameters - number of trees and number of attributes sampled. 

## Data
RandomForestEnsemble uses data from several sources to induce different models.
#### Habermanâ€™s Survival Data Set

#### Wine Data Set

#### Contraceptive Method Choice

#### Breast Cancer Wisconsin (32 atributos, 569 exemplos, 2 classes)

## Evaluation
Random Forest Ensemble measures accuracy and other quality indicators with cross validation, selecting the best models among the a pool of differently parameterized trees.

## Why?
This is a project for UFRGS's (Univerdade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul) subject Neural Networks and Fuzzy Systems, of the Computer Engineering degree.
